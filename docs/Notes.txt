============================
Organize the Form Propertly
============================

1 - Group the related fields - They are easy to read
Ex.
Personal Information
- First Name
- Last Name
Billing Information
- Address
- Phone Number

2 - Hide unesessary inputs until they are needed

3- Called action - that buttom needs to stand out
Ex. Submit (with a good color that shows the action)

=================
Show Helper Text
=================

Helper text or acompany text: explain the user how name, adress or credit card will be used.
Don't use helper text unless it's necessary.

We can use the helper text user trigger - a link or a icon that can click or hover on that shows a pop up or tool tip with the helper text. Use few words as possible.

======================================
Use the Correct Input Type and Length
======================================

When we are working with forms we have inputs of different types.

Always use the correct input type and lenght
- checkboxes
- radio buttons
- selects
Select the right type of bottom according to their characteristics

Radio button - For chose a button of a single list 
Select vs. Radio buttons - More than 5 options in your list this will preserve lots of vertical space
Checkboxes - For multiple selections  
Multiple checkboxes - Can use on/off switch

Text based inputs - Set according to the expected value
The text areas - Necessary space to type and to read.
The fields don't need to necessary have the same width.
Ex. the zip code don't need to have the same space as the street name.

Avoid: 
Tall and arrow text areas
Wide and short text areas

Better:
50/60 characters per line
10 lines in height

====================================
Provide Clear Labels for Each Field
====================================

Users can scan the form and know what is required of them

Use a conversation with the user not a interrogation 

It's common to use the fields inside the inputs, this works fine until you start to fill in. Then you don't know the field that you here in. It's recomended to use an external label.

Label: you tell users what they need to fill in
For label:
- Simple it's better
- Use maximum of two words per label
- Label position (better use it's in the on top of the fields but it's not a rule)
- Always mark witch fields are required and the optional (usually with *)

===============================================
Let Users Know About the Expected Input Format
===============================================

It's more easy to enter data when you know the expected format. Make easy to the users and provide a helper tag to know which format we want. 
Ex.
Enter your birth date
Month/Day/Year 

==============
Give Feedback
==============

Tell the user when they made a mistake or when they reach a milestone.
When a Error message appear it's useful to tell the user what is wrong sometimes using a * and a red message.
We can offer suggestions.
Also say when a form is filling incorrectly.
When a user fill a form we can use a successively message.

====================================
Think About Users on Mobile Devices
====================================

Be carefull:
- font-sizes

On small screen space it's really valuable
Consider the heights of the fields because we have to tap on the screen if the field it's not tall enought it's dificult.
There is no hoverstate so skip this state and focus on the normal one.
