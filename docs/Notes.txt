============================
Organize the Form Propertly
============================

1 - Group the related fields - They are easy to read
Ex.
Personal Information
- First Name
- Last Name
Billing Information
- Address
- Phone Number

2 - Hide unesessary inputs until they are needed

3- Called action - that buttom needs to stand out
Ex. Submit (with a good color that shows the action)

=================
Show Helper Text
=================

Helper text or acompany text: explain the user how name, adress or credit card will be used.
Don't use helper text unless it's necessary.

We can use the helper text user trigger - a link or a icon that can click or hover on that shows a pop up or tool tip with the helper text. Use few words as possible.

======================================
Use the Correct Input Type and Length
======================================

When we are working with forms we have inputs of different types.

Always use the correct input type and lenght
- checkboxes
- radio buttons
- selects
Select the right type of bottom according to their characteristics

Radio button - For chose a button of a single list 
Select vs. Radio buttons - More than 5 options in your list this will preserve lots of vertical space
Checkboxes - For multiple selections  
Multiple checkboxes - Can use on/off switch

Text based inputs - Set according to the expected value
The text areas - Necessary space to type and to read.
The fields don't need to necessary have the same width.
Ex. the zip code don't need to have the same space as the street name.

Avoid: 
Tall and arrow text areas
Wide and short text areas

Better:
50/60 characters per line
10 lines in height
